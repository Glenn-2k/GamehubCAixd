Brief
In this assignment, you will be required to modify your existing Cross-Course Project to fetch products from an external API. Your project should already have a product list page and a product detail page with hardcoded data, but you will now need to modify them to fetch data dynamically from the API.

The product list page should display a list of all products fetched from the API, and the user should be able to click on a product to view its details on a separate product detail page. You should ensure that the product data is not hardcoded into the HTML, but instead fetched dynamically from the API to display the latest data. Your API calls should include a loading indicator to show the user that data is being fetched. Additionally, you should implement error handling to catch any errors that may occur when fetching data and display an appropriate message on the page. Make sure that your project is tested thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
